# OPC UA

OPC UA is a machine-to-machine communication protocol for industrial automation developed and maintained by the OPC Foundation. OPC UA provides a standardized way for different devices and systems to communicate with each other.

The Neuron OPC UA plugin can be used as a client to access KEPServerEX, Industrial Gateway OPC Server, Prosys Simulation Server, Ignition, and other OPC UA servers. You can also directly access the built-in OPC UA Server of hardware equipment, such as the built-in Server of Siemens S7-1200 PLC, the built-in Server of Omron NJ series PLC, etc.

## Add Device

Go to **Configuration -> South Devices**, then click **Add Device** to add the driver. Configure the following settings in the popup dialog box.

- Name: The name of this device node.
- Plugin: Select the **OPC UA** plugin.

## Device Configuration

After clicking **Create**, you will be redirected to the **Device Configuration** page, where we will set up the parameters required for Neuron to establish a connection with the device. You can also click the device configuration icon on the southbound device card to enter the **Device Configuration** interface.

| Parameter        | Description                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Endpoint URL** | Target OPC UA Server URL, the default value is `opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4840/` |
| **Username**     | User name used to connect to the target OPC UA Server                      |
| **Password**     | Password for connecting to the target OPC UA Server                        |
| **Cert**         | Client certificate in DER format                                           |
| **Key**          | The client key in DER format                                               |
| **Security Mode**  | Set the security policy for the OPC UA connection: None/Sign/Sign&Encrypt, with the default being None. |
| **Update Mode**    | Set the data acquisition mode for OPC UA: Read/Subscribe/ Read&Subscribe, with the default being Read. |
| **Publish Interval**  | The minimum interval between two publish operations when configuring OPC UA to collect data in Subscribe/Read&Subscribe mode. |

## Update Mode
**Read** mode: The data update method is consistent with the previous version, using the OPC UA standard read interface to obtain data from the Server. This is also the default data update method.

**Subscribe** mode: A new data update method that uses the OPC UA standard subscription interface to get Server data. Upon successful subscription, data is updated in bulk once, and thereafter updates occur only when the Server data changes.

**Read&Subscribe** mode: A new data update method that simultaneously uses both the read interface and the subscription interface to obtain Server data.

**Publish Interval** defines the fastest rate at which the OPC UA server sends point update values to NeuronEX in a loop when the **Update Mode** is set to Subscribe or Read&Subscribe. If this parameter is set to 0, the fastest publish interval supported by the OPC UA server is used. The interval is expressed in milliseconds. The default value is 500 ms, meaning the fastest point update rate sent by the OPC UA server to NeuronEX is 500 ms.

::: tip
The **Update Mode** is set in the global parameters of the southbound node and indicates that the southbound node obtains data via OPC UA subscription. Meanwhile, the Subscribe attribute in the NeuronEX tags settings means that when the value of this tag changes, it immediately triggers an upload report to the northbound application. Setting both together allows you to obtain real-time data change reports.

## Configure Data Groups and Tags

After the plug-in is added and configured, the next step is to establish communication between your device and Neuron by adding groups and tags to the Southbound driver.

Once device configuration is completed, navigate to the **South Devices** page. Click on the device card or device row to access the **Group List** page. Here, you can create a new group by clicking on **Create**, then specifying the group name and data collection interval.

Upon successfully creating a group, click on its name to proceed to the **Tag List** page. This page allows you to add device tags for data collection. You'll need to provide information such as the tag address, attributes, and data type.

For information on general configuration items, see [Connect to Southbound Devices](../south-devices.md). The subsequent section will concentrate on configurations specific to the driver.

::: tip

You can use UaExpert to view the **Namespace Index** ( `NamespaceIndex`) and is the **Node ID** ( `Identifier`), for details, see [UaExpert](./uaexpert.md). 

- For an explanation of namespace indexes and node ids, refer to the OPC UA standard.
- The Neuron set data type must match the OPC UA data type.

### Address Format

> NS[x,y,z]!NODEID

**NS** Namespace index.

**[x,y,z]** Array index, when the data type is array, you can use the index to get to the value of a specific location, the dimension counts from 0, the dimension is not more than 2. x means one-dimensional index, y means two-dimensional index, z means three-dimensional index.

**NODEID** The node ID, which can be set as a number, a string, or a GUID.
